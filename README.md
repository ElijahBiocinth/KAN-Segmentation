This repository contains a dataset and an example KAN implementation for the segmentation process by used V100.

It is based on https://github.com/KindXiaoming/pykan/tree/master and
https://github.com/Blealtan/efficient-kan/tree/master

Dataset link (DSB2018 and my data) for tests: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1B4oicusB-1jR3Iej5Da7E51HaYfoL_yb/view?usp=sharing

The play is endless, especially with the combination of ConvLSTM and VAE. Good luck to you!
